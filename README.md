# Examining the effect of handwashing on mortality rates
## Overview
This project reanalyzes the data that led Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis to discover the importance of handwashing in reducing mortality rates. The data comes from the two clinics at the Vienna General Hospital in the 1840s, where Dr. Semmelweis worked. The project aims to visualize the impact of handwashing on mortality rates and to calculate a confidence interval to determine the uncertainty around the estimate of this effect.

## Data
The data for this project comes from the Vienna General Hospital and includes the number of births at the two clinics, as well as the number of deaths at each clinic. The data covers the years 1841 to 1846.

## Results
The analysis shows that handwashing had a significant impact on reducing mortality rates at Clinic 1. The proportion of deaths due to childbirth decreased from around **10% to 2%** after the implementation of a handwashing protocol. A **95% confidence interval** indicates that the true reduction in mortality rates due to handwashing is between **6.7 and 10** percentage points.
